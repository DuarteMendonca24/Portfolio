        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
          Island 51 is a top-down 2D survival horror game. The game begins with
          a plane crash, leaving the protagonist stranded and empty-handed on a
          mysterious island. The goal is to escape the island, in order to do
          that , the player must collect resources , craft weapons , find food
          and defeat the various enemies. <br /><br />
          This game was developed during my time studying abroad at the
          Technological University of the Shannon in Ireland. It was created for
          the course "Project and Team Dynamics" and developed by a team
          consisting of myself, Kamil Woloszyn, Kai Cheng Wong, and Emmanuel
          Kadree. The project follows the theme of Games Fleadh 2024, "Start
          with Nothing," and was selected by our professor to compete in the
          Games Fleadh competition.

            <p>
              The first task that I was assigned was the creation of different
              types of enemies. I came up with the ideas to create some generic
              enemies: a shooting enemy, an enemy that makes the player hunger
              bar decrease, an illusionist enemy that spawns 4 copies of itself
              but only 1 is real, and a boss enemy.<br /><br />
              After analyzing the code of a previous game developed called
              “Zombie”, I realized that it already contained different types of
              enemies, each with unique variables to define their speed, health,
              and the amount of score the player would receive by killing them.
              Because of that, creating more generic enemies would be easy; I
              would simply have to change the values of the variables to match
              my intended goal.<br /><br />
              After doing that, I started realizing that using an array to store
              the enemies wouldn’t be the most optimal choice to let me add and
              delete objects freely. Which leads me to my second task, changing
              the arrays to lists. I was successful in completing this task, and
              after doing that, I also changed my code to use pointers. I took a
              similar approach to another previous developed game called “Thomas
              was Late,” where pointers are used in combination with lists.

              My next task involved developing functions for various enemy
              mechanics. I created a function to spawn two additional enemies
              when a specific enemy was killed, utilized the bullets class
              function for shooting, implemented a timer for enemy shooting, and
              set up collision detection to decrease the player's hunger bar
              upon enemy contact.<br /><br />
              For the illusionist enemy, I took a different approach by creating
              an array for the illusionist and spawning four illusions around
              the player when they got close. The array randomized which
              illusion was real, with the others only being destroyed when the
              real one was defeated.

              I implemented a resource inventory that could be toggled using the "Tab" key. 
              This task revealed that the text and bar elements were disorganized, prompting me to create a "HUD" class. 
              The HUD class managed the heads-up display, providing essential information and graphical elements for the player.

                Working with Jeff, we tackled the task of preventing the player from leaving the map. 
                We created a function in the "Engine" class to detect collisions with water tiles. 
                We encountered issues with the code detecting multiple collisions simultaneously (e.g., right side and head), which caused confusion and allowed the player to leave the intended boundaries. 
                To fix this, we adjusted the collision detection logic and the player's hitbox for more accurate and believable behavior.

              I implemented a system to save the top five high scores to a text file, finding this approach more engaging than a single high score. 
              At the game's end, the code compares the player's score with the top five high scores and updates them accordingly. 
              I also added main menu options to exit the game and view the rules and high scores. While doing this, I noticed the "HandleInput" class was confusing, so I reorganized the code to enhance readability.

              Throughout the project, I assisted in resolving various issues. 
              I fixed problems with enemy shooting, illusion mechanics, map tile stretching, and pickups. 
              As we neared project completion, I focused on organizing the code, adding missing comments, and removing unused code. 
              I also identified and deleted code attempting to load unnecessary sounds and graphics, streamlining the project's asset folder.
